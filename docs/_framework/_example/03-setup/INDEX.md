# kol-zine — setup

Sequential playbook. Read top-to-bottom, copy-paste commands as you go.

## Sequence

| #   | Step              | What it covers                                          |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01  | [[01-prerequisites|prerequisites]] | Accounts, tooling, env vars needed before anything else |
| 02  | [[02-install|install]]       | Clone, install deps, run dev server                     |
| 03  | [[03-deploy|deploy]]        | Vercel + Printful wiring, first deploy                  |

Each step assumes the previous has shipped clean.
