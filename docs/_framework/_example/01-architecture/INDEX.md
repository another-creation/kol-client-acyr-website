# kol-zine — architecture decisions

Three decisions locked. Everything downstream flows from these.

## D1 — Print-on-demand over inventory

**Context.** Zines are low-volume, high-variation. Holding inventory means dead capital and pulp waste.

**Decision.** Print-on-demand via Printful. Order triggers print, ships direct.

**Consequences.** Higher unit cost. No upfront print runs. Fulfillment time +2–3 days vs in-house. Inventory risk → zero.

## D2 — Single-page app, no CMS

**Context.** Zine catalogue is small (<50 SKUs), changes monthly.

**Decision.** SPA with content baked into `src/content/`. No Sanity, no headless CMS.

**Consequences.** Catalog updates require a deploy. Deploy is 90s on Vercel. Tradeoff acceptable until catalog exceeds ~100 SKUs.

## D3 — Brand-tier and DS-tier separated from day one

**Context.** Past projects collapsed brand into DS, then had to rip them apart.

**Decision.** `packages/ds/` and `packages/brand-data/` from project start. No brand values in DS files. No DS primitives in brand files.

**Consequences.** Slightly more ceremony when adding a brand color. Avoids the rebind cascade that's bitten every previous project.
